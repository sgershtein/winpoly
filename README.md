Differential games modelling

An approximate calculation of the positional absorption sets in problems on the plane can be carried out on a computer using algorithms, which are based on procedures of intersecting and uniting non-convex limited polygons with internal holes.

This code provides functions for calculating intersections and unions of multiple vertex polygons with polygonal holes.  It was used for my doctorate thesis (not finished) in 1995-97.  More information can be found in the tex file in Artice folder.
